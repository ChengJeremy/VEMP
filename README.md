# VEMP

Given the prevalence of vestibular dysfunctions, it is crucial for healthcare professionals to have a tool that allows for easy diagnosis of vestibular disorders. Currently, there is no singular test that can help in clinical diagnoses, and doctors use a myriad of tests as the gold standard to decide if a person suffers from any disorders. 

Ultimately, this project aims to develop a portable, low-cost, and reliable diagnostic system that will be capable of delivering bone-conducted force stimulation and measuring cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMP) and ocular VEMPs (oVEMP) responses.

This project provides an innovative means to monitor gravitational receptor function that will be useful in clinical otolaryngology, audiology settings and ototoxicity testing.
